   <h1>Duke City Blues</h1>
<p class="intro-text">From its beginning African Americans have lived in Albuquerque. These pages look at their lives since 1880. While escaping the entrenched racial caste system of the South for the ethos of freedom and self-reliance in the West, African Americans still had to deal with the echoes of that racist system. That racism limited them to menial jobs for the most part, housing segregation at times, segregation in public facilities like theaters, and other occasional indignities. Despite these challenges to their humanity and citizenship they manage to create full lives for themselves, to produce valiant albeit usually short-lived efforts at entrepreneurship, to establish networks of kinship and friendship that spread throughout the West, to find a spiritual life in black churches, to support the education and advancement of their children and to build organizations like men’s and women’s clubs or the NAACP that worked to improve and defend their communities. These are the stories of their struggles and accomplishments.</p>
